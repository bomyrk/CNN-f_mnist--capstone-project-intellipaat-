# CNN-f_mnist Convolutional Neural Network on fashion-mnist dataset of Zolando
 This is a convolutional network on the fashion mnist dataset of Zalando

Objective â€“ Create a Classification Deep learning model using the Keras/Tensorflow framework

The description is below

The data can be downloaded from https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist

Problem statement:
 -  Can we create a separate Docker container for each component?
 -  Can we have more than 2 Web docker containers?
 -  Can we scale up the no. of web containers?
 -  Can we scale down the no. of web containers?

Have to use
1. Convolutional Neural Network
2. Visualize the Error/Accuracy with Tensorboard.
3. Save the model and submit the best weights for the corresponding epoch
4. The accuracy needs to be calculated on the Test data set.

Things need to be submitted -
1. Model architecture
2. Model Weights
3. Model accuracy metrics
4. tensorboard snapshot
