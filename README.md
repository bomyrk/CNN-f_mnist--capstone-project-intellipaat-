# CNN-f_mnist Convolutional Neural Network on fashion-mnist dataset of Zolando
 This is a convolutionnal network on fashion mnist dataset of Zolando

Objective – C reate a Classification Deep learning model using Keras/Tensorflow framework
The description is below
● The data can be downloaded from https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist

Problem statement:
● Can we create separate Docker container for each component?
● Can we have more than 2 Web docker containers?
● Can we scale up the no. of web containers?
● Can we scale down the no. of web containers?

Have to use
1. Convolutional Neural Network
2. Visualize the Error/Accuracy with Tensorboard.
3. Save the model and submit the best weights for corresponding epoch
4.The accuracy needs to be calculated on Test data set.

Things need to submitted -
1.Model architecture
2. Model Weights
3. Model accuracy metrics
4. tensorboard snapshot
